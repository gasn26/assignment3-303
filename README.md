## Description
The required functions are stored in functions.h, while the driver code is located in main.cpp. Upon running, the program will create a queue of 3 elements, move the first element to the end, and print itself. 
 
Next, it uses the recursive function defined in functions.h to test a palindrome. One of the examples should be a palindrome, the other one isn't.
 
In the third part, it creates a map for different capital cities and prints the data out. It changes the capital of California to Los Angeles and allows the user to input a state to find the capital of.
 
 
Finally, the answers to the other questions are stored in trees.txt.
